              History
         </h3>
            <p>
            Many years ago the most famous Hobbit of all, Bilbo Baggins, daringly departed his home, The Shire, located in Middle Earth. Goaded on by that rascal wizard Gandalf the Gray, he went on an adventure, something no Hobbit had done in the history of The Shire. He was gone many years and saw many things and many different sorts of beings. There were elves, dwarves, men, wolves, dragons, orcs and goblins to name a few. He saw places like he had never seen in the Shire. He experienced some problems but returned safely to The Shire.
            </p>
              <p>
              Frodo did much the same years later with his friends Sam, Merry and Pippin.
              </p>
                  <p>
                  But now there is a problem. Too many young Hobbits are leaving on their own adventures. But they are running into problems.
